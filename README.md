## Features

The project is designed for desktop and mobile versions.

## Status

Project is: completed in basic project.

For now the live preview shows a basic version of a Random Meme Generator. The user can insert their own captions and they will be visible alongside the meme generated. It is a simple application with flaws (the pictures are of different shapes and sizes and they sometimes render incorrectly).

COMPLETED:

- basic components of the Meme Generator,
- basic implementation of styles,
- working JS code,
- backend for handling posts and authentication,
- MongoDB connection,
- creating user accounts,
- upload of memes, deletion and liking/disliking as a logged in user,
- final fixes with mobile views, 
- **information dialogs**: creating client side information dialogs/snackbars for success/info/warning/error informations from the backend,
- **refactor of all dialogs and forms**.

## Planned implementations

The following are planned to be implemented:

- **pagination**: separating the amount of visible posts and creating pages,
- **search engine**: searching through tags,
- **comments section**: comments will be available for logged in users; the post will show itself in a lightbox window with a comments section
- **gallery**: a full gallery like view of all memes with lightbox,
- **generator**: meme generator from blank pictures available in the database (or uploaded by the user)/ a generated meme can be either uploaded to the site or downloaded for private use,
- **weekly subscription**: everyone who signs up for the subscription will receive weekly emails with new uploads,
- how to instructions.
