## General info

The project has been created as part of my 'Szko≈Ça Reacta' course. It is intended to be my final individual project. The source is provided below.

The scope of the course is to use what I have learned during the course about React, API, backend, testing, etc.

For now the project is in MVP stage and will be expanded in the future with additional features.

## Technologies

- React, JavaScript, JSX
- HTML 5
- CSS, Sass
- Node.js

## Libraries used

- Sass
- chakra UI

## Setup

[live preview](https://codesandbox.io/s/nifty-hofstadter-qnwyh)
Styles are to be updated.

## Features

The project is designed for desktop version.

## Status

Project is: in progress.

For now the live preview shows a basic version of a Random Meme Generator. The user can insert their own captions and they will be visible alongside the meme generated. It is a simple application with flaws (the pictures are of different shapes and sizes and they sometimes render incorrectly).

COMPLETED:

- basic components of the Meme Generator,
- basic implementation of styles,
- working JS code.

The following are planned to be implemented:

- users can choose from a gallery which meme to use,
- pictures and captions will work better alongside each other,
- some memes can me saved in the gallery and viewed by others,
- I intend to implement commenting and rating system,
- subscription for weekly e-mails with IT memes and other things,
- how to instructions.

## Updates

None for now.

## Inspiration

The project has been inspired by a few Meme Generator apps that have been created:
